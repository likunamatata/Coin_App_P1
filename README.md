## Coin Tracker

*The purpose of this web app is to give its users an opportunity to keep an eye on the value performance of
the more popular crypto currencies. I chose an eye-catching design to stand out from the fluorocent-office-looking financial 
pages and organized the information in an easy to digest dashboard framework. The displayed information is the courtesy of 
CoinGecko API :lizard:. Additional features include the ability to choose a currency for populating dashboard prices with and also a second page where the user can read the news referencing a crypto coin of their interest. The articles on the second page are provided by NewsAPI :newspaper:.*


To quickly check out what the app looks like, you can visit https://likuna-dev.surge.sh/ or https://amazing-swartz-f88056.netlify.com/news.html


* MVP: Coin Tracker

* Post-MVP: Coin News

* Post-Post-MVP: To fuel the options on the Coin News dropdown using the coin titles that come up in the CoinGecko API rather than the locked-in array of strings that I am using currently.

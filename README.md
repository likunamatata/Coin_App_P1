## Coin Tracker

*The purpose of this web app is to give its users an opportunity to keep an eye on the value performance of
the more popular crypto currencies. I chose an eye-catching design to stand out from the fluorocent-office-looking financial 
pages and organized the information in an easy to digest dashboard framework. The displayed information is the courtesy of 
CoinGecko API :lizard:. Additional features include the ability to choose a currency for populating dashboard prices with and also a second page where
the user can read the news referencing a crypto coin of their interest. The articles on the second page are provided by NewsAPI :newspaper:.*
